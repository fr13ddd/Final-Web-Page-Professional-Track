      <h1>Welcome to Our Design Selection!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our design selection! This is a professional track. Here we
        showcase two unique mug designs, each with its own unique style and
        character. However, the world of design isn't always all about the cream
        of the crop, and sometimes we come across ideas that don't quite work.
        That's why we need your help to decide: which mug design is more
        disappointing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a closer look at the images of the two mugs below and use our
        voting system to choose which one you think is the lesser design. Your
        choices will help us understand what design elements failed to live up
        to viewers' expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, every choice is valuable feedback for the designers. We look
        forward to your participation to discuss and learn how to make the
        design even better!

            I can't quite understand the theme of this design, it doesn't seem
            to have a clear focus.

            It felt okay, but a little too fancy.This design tries too many
            elements to blend together and ends up looking disorganized.
